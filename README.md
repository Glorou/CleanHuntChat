# CleanHuntChat

A FFXIV Dalamud plugin that provides a clean chat experience during hunt trains.

Usage: 

* /cleanhunt - Enables the plugin for a configurable amount of time (default is 1 hour)

* /cleanhunt off - Manually disables the plugin before the time is over.

When the plugin is enabled via /cleanhunt, every Shout and Yell message that doesn't contain a coordinate flag, or the word "instance", gets hidden.
